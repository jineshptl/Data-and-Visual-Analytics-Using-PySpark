# Data-and-Visual-Analytics-Using-PySpark
This project heavily involves backend processing with PySpark to handle and analyze large datasets, utilizing cloud services like AWS and GCP. It does not explicitly include the development of a user interface, thus it's not typically considered a full-stack project.

# Data and Visual Analytics Using PySpark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of PySpark to process and analyze a large dataset from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. It focuses on handling big data effectively using cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, showcasing advanced data processing techniques and cloud integration.

## Objectives
- To handle and analyze large-scale data using PySpark.
- To implement cloud solutions for data processing tasks.
- To derive meaningful insights from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission data set.

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For data processing and analytics.
- **AWS/GCP**: Used for hosting and executing data processing tasks in the cloud.
- **Python**: For scripting and additional data manipulation.

## Features
- **Data Transformation and Aggregation**: Utilizing PySpark to perform complex data transformations and aggregations.
- **Optimized Query Execution**: Implementing efficient data querying techniques to minimize execution time and resource usage.
- **Scalable Cloud Integration**: Configuring and deploying PySpark jobs on cloud platforms to leverage scalable resources.

## Setup and Running
1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine.
    - Install PySpark: `pip install pyspark`.
    - Set up an AWS or GCP account and configure access credentials on your local machine.

2. **Running the Project**:
    - Clone the repository: `git clone https://your-github-repo-link`
    - Navigate to the project directory: `cd Data-Analytics-Using-PySpark`
    - Run the PySpark script: `spark-submit your-script.py`

## Data
The data used in this project is sourced from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, which provides comprehensive details on taxi trips across the city, including pick-up and drop-off times, locations, distances traveled, fares, and other related attributes.
